# Question 2

# Let's create a function that turns text into pig latin: a simple text transformation that modifies each word moving the first character to the end and appending "ay" to the end. For example, python ends up as ythonpay.

def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  # Separate the text into words
  words = ___
  for word in words:
    # Create the pig latin word and add it to the list
    ___
    # Turn the list back into a phrase
  return ___
		
print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
